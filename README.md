 Simple Login and Sign Up console application with Python

I've started to Pyton 3-4 days ago and I wanted to do something simple as a practice. In couple of days I'll take a look to Tkinter and I'll try to add some visual stuff to this project.
If you find any bugs or if you think this is something cool, please give a feedback. Thanks!
13 hours later from my first commit of this mini-project. tkinter update has been done. app runs perfectly. still need some visual improvments but back-end works just fine
#edit3 sqlite database added. saves and updates to database and of course checks from database. Still need some visual updates but that is not an issue at the moment for me.there is a small bug i guess which is when you create a profile and click the sign up button, right after this if you try to login it will not login. i dont know why right now ill make a search for this and fix it on the next commit. if you know why please let me know. if anyone reads this of course. anyway thanks people
 #edit4 QtPy5 upgrade part1 is done
