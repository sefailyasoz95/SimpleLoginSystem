 Simple Login and Sign Up console application with Python

I've started to Pyton 3-4 days ago and I wanted to do something simple as a practice. In couple of days I'll take a look to Tkinter and I'll try to add some visual stuff to this project.
If you find any bugs or if you think this is something cool, please give a feedback. Thanks!
